# Stream Status

A small [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) app for showing Twitch/Own3d stream status images. Currently running on [streamstatus.herokuapp.com](http://streamstatus.herokuapp.com/).

# Why?

This started as an exercise to see how Heroku works, and then evolve it into learning some new stuff -- this was also my first app using Sinatra and Memcache.
