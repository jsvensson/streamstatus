# Stream Status [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jsvensson/streamstatus.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jsvensson/streamstatus)

A small [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) app for showing Twitch/Own3d stream status images. Currently running on [streamsigs.herokuapp.com](http://streamsigs.herokuapp.com/).

# Why?

This started as an exercise to see how Heroku works, and then evolve it into learning some new stuff -- this was also my first app using [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and [Memcache](http://memcached.org/).
